I worked 3 months as an inten at Nabz Company. During my internship, I created a charging hub that was needed for product lines of Nabz company. For desinging the charging hub, I did the following phases:

## Phase 1:
I literature reviewed the ISO13485 standrad (form e Research Gate, Scopus and Google Scholar)

## Phase 2:
Desinging the transformator using "PI Express" software. Then, examined my design which was acceptable.
The schematic diagram I designed:

Also the schematic diagram in Altium designer I designed:

## Phase 3: Experiment
In experimenting the developed device, TNY280PN IC got so hot and died whithin few minutes. Then, we had an idea of using heat sink. The result was perfect and the production line started to use it.
