During my 3-month internship at Nabz Company, I was tasked with creating a charging hub essential for Nabz's product lines. The development of this charging hub involved several phases:

## Phase 1: Literature Review
I commenced by conducting an extensive literature review of the ISO 13485 standard, utilizing research sources such as Research Gate, Scopus, and Google Scholar to gain comprehensive insights.

## Phase 2: Transformer Design
In the second phase, I employed the "PI Express" software to design the transformer. Subsequently, I thoroughly evaluated my design to ensure its suitability for the project. This included creating a schematic diagram, as shown in following image:

and an Altium Designer schematic diagram, as displayed in the following picture:

## Phase 3: Experimentation
Upon moving to the experimentation phase, an unexpected issue arose when the TNY280PN IC became excessively hot and ultimately failed within a few minutes. In response, we devised the idea of implementing a heat sink. This modification yielded excellent results, allowing the production line to begin using the charging hub successfully.
